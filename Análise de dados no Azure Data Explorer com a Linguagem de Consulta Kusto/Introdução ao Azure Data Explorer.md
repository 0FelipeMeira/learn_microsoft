## Introduction

</summary>
Daily operations and interactions with customers create a constant flow of data. This world of big data is growing steadily, and so is the need to store, process, and analyze the data in a timely and cost-efficient way. Big data requires large amounts of scalable storage space. Because huge volumes of data flow in at high velocity from various sources, the ability to identify and respond to meaningful events is key. Additionally, data is generated in various formats: structured/semi-structured data and free text, as well as images and videos. In order to find correlations between these different data flows, businesses invest significant time and money into parsing, processing, and storing this data. A robust end-to-end data analytics system that can manage your huge, complex data and run advanced analytics is essential to make data-driven business decisions.

Azure Data Explorer is a fully managed, high-performance, big data analytics platform. Azure Data Explorer can take all this varied data, and then ingest, process, and store it. You can use Azure Data Explorer for near real-time queries and advanced analytics, as well as for more advanced features such as geospatial analytics, alerting, dashboarding, and business analytics.
